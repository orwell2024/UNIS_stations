# Adventdalen Weather Data Analysis

This script downloads and analyzes temperature data from the Adventdalen weather station. It generates several visualizations to highlight temperature trends over time.

## What the Script Does

1. **Downloads and Unzips Data**: Automatically downloads the weather data from the UNIS Weather Data Portal and extracts it for analysis.

2. **Processes the Data**: Loads the data, assigns proper column names, and prepares it for visualization.

3. **Generates Plots**:
   - **August Average Temperatures**: Focuses on August data, showing a trendline to highlight changes over time.
   - **3x4 Grid of Monthly Average Temperatures**: Creates a grid of subplots for each month, showing monthly averages and trendlines.
   - **Overall Temperature Trend**: Plots the entire dataset with a trendline to display long-term temperature trends.
